  text: |- 
    Nancy brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to City Yearâ€™s Board. In addition to her passion for our mission and her steadfast commitment to our success, Nancy has helped our organization during its start-up phase to create structures that increase our operational efficiency and overall output which allows us to provide more support to off-track Sacramento students. Having a high-functioning board is important for any organization, but as a non-profit that does not have the luxury of time or money, board activation and cultivation is crucial. As Chair of our Board Leadership Development Committee, Nancy has helped to shape and define board responsibilities and structures, board growth and board member accountability. We are incredibly lucky to have Nancy serve with City Year and can attribute much of our operational success to her hard work.
