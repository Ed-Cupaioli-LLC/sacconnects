    Nancy brings so much experience and knowledge to board building and networking, specifically in the Sacramento Community.   She has been instrumental in working with our organization to push out our Youth & Family Collective Initiative, which focuses on designing and developing new ways for nonprofits to work together.  She opened the doors to numerous new partnerships and opportunities.  Nancy is the greatest contagious cheerleader that an organization and leader can have.
