    The Sacramento Ballet would like to thank Nancy Brodovsky of SacConnects for her continued support assisting the Ballet efforts in identifying and screening board recruits. After several years running with a lean board we felt it was time to expand our board, understanding the next step was not that easy, who? We turned to a new start-up in the area, SacConnects, to help us with the daunting task of identifying, recruiting and closing on new board members who will ultimately assist the Ballet in its mission. Nancy and SacConnects took the time to understand our goals and board needs before recommending a single candidate. To date SacConnects has helped the Sacramento Ballet Company fill several vacant board seats in a timely and effortless fashion. SacConnects worked closely with the Board and recruitment committee to determine the best candidates for the open positions. We have been ecstatic with the level of professionalism and service we have received from SacConnects and the candidates that have been brought forth by them!
