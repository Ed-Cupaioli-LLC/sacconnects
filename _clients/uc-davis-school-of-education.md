    Nancy Brodovsky at SacConnects is a wonderful asset to the UC Davis School of Education as both a Board Member and consultant helping us continue to develop our volunteer and philanthropic programs. She is attentive, creative, energetic and thoughtful. Nancy has given me and my team practical advice that we can implement today to improve our outreach and relationship-building efforts.
