review:
  text: As a transplant to Sacramento, I was looking for someone who could help to
    introduce me to the Sacramento community.  Nancy not only suggested and made
    strategic introductions, but also her enthusiastic and genuine love of the
    Sacramento region help me build bridges across different sectors in order to
    grow the organization.  She helped to foster numerous new partnerships and
    opportunities.  Her strategic connections and ability to see partnership is
    invaluable to any organization.  She is beloved in the Sacramento community
    and passionate about connecting people and organizations for the good of our
    region.  Her facilitation of large groups with diverse priorities and goals
    is evident in ensuring the success of the individual and organization at
    large.
  excerpt: Nancy was instrumental to introducing me to the Sacramento community
    and helping to build enthusiastic support for the Tree Foundation’s Seed to
    Slab mission to new members of the community.   Her energetic, thoughtful,
    and authentic advice ensured that our meetings were productive, successful,
    and allowed us to establish new coalitions.
