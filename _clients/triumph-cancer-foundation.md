review:
  text: We had the pleasure of working with Nancy Brodovsky in various capacities
    when we needed help in shaping our Board and developing a strategic plan. 
    Her long-term experience in the nonprofit world and deep roots in our
    community were invaluable to our Foundation.  Her approach was engaging and
    thoughtful as she assisted us in prioritizing our goals and focus. She lead
    us through a day-long retreat with both Board members and team members that
    was informative, well-organized, and fun - and allowed all of us to craft
    our vision for the future together.  Nancy is truly well-connected in the
    Sacramento region, and it is evident that she is passionate about connecting
    the right people to the right organizations to help with the success of a
    nonprofit.  She is always striving to find that "perfect fit".  We truly
    appreciated her commitment to our Foundation and her desire to help us
    further our mission.
