    Nancy was tremendously helpful in finding the perfect candidate to join RedRoverâ€™s Board of Directors. RedRover is a national organization based in Sacramento seeking to become better known in our own community. Nancy used her wide network to identify a community member with the exact skills and strengths we were looking for, and she helped connect me with others by identifying events that would be worthwhile attending and coordinating meetings with like-minded individuals. It is clear Nancy is well-regarded and well-connected and passionate about strengthening the Sacramento nonprofit community and helping leaders and organizations achieve their goals. I would highly recommend her services.
