    Nancy brings a very special energy to everything she touches. Her first thought in every conversation is always “How can I help this person by sharing my wide network and my knowledge of what is happening in the region?”. Her enthusiasm is so contagious that people want her to be part of what they are doing, and I have yet to find anyone that can say no to her. She has a very disarming way of helping you take a fresh look or consider a new approach. If you want to infuse a creative mix of regional knowledge and connections with renewed energy – Nancy is your best choice.
