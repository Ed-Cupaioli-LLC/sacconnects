    Nancy’s energy and passion for serving the Sacramento community is boundless. Her dynamic network within the community and special talent of being able to find the right person to contribute to a variety of boards truly makes her a valuable asset to Sacramento. If you haven’t met Nancy yet, you probably have seen her, as she is involved in a wide range of activities. We are thrilled to have SacConnects working with us to find more committed board members.
