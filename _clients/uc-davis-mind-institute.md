    I have known Nancy Brodovsky for over 20 years and have worked with her in various organizations. I have found her to be:

    * Inclusive â€“ she recognizes the importance of diversity in cultural, socio-economic, and religious groups in all aspects of the community,
    * To have terrific connections throughout the community, across all areas: from art groups to medical organizations, law to business and community leaders, non-profits to for profit,
    * And an expert at leading meetings and discussions, including those that are challenging.
