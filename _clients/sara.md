    In 2016, Save the American River Association (SARA) engaged SacConnects to find qualified persons for consideration as members of our board of directors. We asked Nancy Brodovsky to specifically seek younger candidates so that our 501(c)(3) non-profit may begin moulding a board capable of performing our role well into the 21st Century. After a reasonable time period, Nancy provided two very well-qualified candidates, both very acceptable to SARA. As SARA needs additional board members, we will not hesitate to once again contact SacConnects.
