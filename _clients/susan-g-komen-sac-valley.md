review:
  text: Nancy Brodovsky and SacConnects provide an invaluable service to the
    nonprofit community. Nancy’s is deeply committed to the nonprofit community
    and her vast connections and years of experience offer the very best
    recruitment network for any board. With Nancy’s help we were able to find
    board members that will lead and grow our organization with passion and
    commitment to our cause.
