review:
  text: Nancy assisted our organization with Board Development Training as a
    contractor in 2018 & 2019.  She is well organized, enthusiastic,
    knowledgeable, and a clear communicator.  We are very grateful to have
    received board development and leadership training with her in 8 cohesive
    sessions including an impactful board retreat.  During her presentations and
    discussions, our board of directors gained inspiration and clarity on their
    roles and responsibilities.  As a result, we were able to cohesively outline
    strategies to meet our goals for the organization.  Nancy was a joy to work
    with and I recommend her to any nonprofit looking for high quality,
    in-person training for their board.
