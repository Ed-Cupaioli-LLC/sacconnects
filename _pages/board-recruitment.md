The difference between an ordinary nonprofit and a extraordinary nonprofit is the people that sit at the table. Many organizations struggle to identify the right leaders.

* Almost one-half of nonprofit leaders report that it is difficult to recruit new members. [(2012 BoardSource Nonprofit Governance Index)](https://www.boardsource.org/eweb/dynamicpage.aspx?webcode=governanceindex "2012 Boardsource Nonprofit Governance Index")
* Almost one-third of chief executives report that they do not have the right board members to effectively govern their organizations. [(2010 BoardSource Nonprofit Governance Index)](https://www.boardsource.org/eweb/dynamicpage.aspx?action=add&objectkeyfrom=1a83491a-9853-4c87-86a4-f7d95601c2e2&webcode=proddetailadd&donotsave=yes&parentobject=centralizedorderentry&parentdataobject=invoice%2520detail&ivd_formkey=69202792-63d7-4ba2-bf4e-a0da41270555&ivd_cst_key&ivd_prc_prd_key=e5a3866f-d904-46d2-91c5-0cf93c1eb89a "2010 BoardSource Nonprofit Governance Index")

The board member attributes you seek are dependent on the skill sets and perspectives that might be missing in your current board. Many boards and nominating committees overlook the preparation required to identify the gaps in diversity of skills and experience that are holding them back from effectively carrying out the mission of the organization.

SacConnects is committed to helping your organization recruit the most relevant individuals to sit on your board.
