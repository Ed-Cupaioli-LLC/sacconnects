## *How effective is it when you go to a board meeting and they discuss a topic which you have no context for?*

## *How effective are new board members who do not understand your organization?*

Once the board comes together, the real work begins. An organization has a responsibility to educate and engage new members. Typically organizations tend to do a very brief and perfunctory job of training their new members.

SacConnects offers a training program to help facilitate this crucial process.

* We survey current board members on topics they feel are important to include and ones that they wish they had a better understanding of.
* We assess this process after the first year to determine if it has met the needs of the members.
* We develop mentorship programs, elevator speeches and social gathering with the rest of the board and staff are additional aspects of the training to ensure cohesion and success.
