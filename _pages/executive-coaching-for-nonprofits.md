## *Will this board meeting ever end?*

## *Doesn't the chair know how to run a board meeting?*

## *This board chair/president is driving me crazy and is working against me not with me, I'm the paid professional!*

## *I'm successful in my career. How hard could it be to be Chair/President?*

Individuals who are very successful in their personal life may not feel they have the skills and confidence to work as a volunteer officer in a non profit setting. Nonprofits work differently and working in a board setting can be very challenging and frustrating. SacConnects wants to make it easier for individuals to be successful while making their nonprofits thrive.

-   We offer "one on one" training sessions.
-   We facilitate and teach "meeting techniques" for running an effective meeting.
-   We develop a process for successful interaction with the Executive Director.
