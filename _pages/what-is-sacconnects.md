## Great People = Great Boards = Great Nonprofits

SacConnects is a boutique consulting firm that focuses on helping nonprofit boards find the most relevant talent to help drive their organization's mission forward. We do this by understanding the skill-sets the organization needs and matching individuals from our network who are the best fit.
