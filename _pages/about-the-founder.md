SacConnects was created because there was a serious need to help nonprofits thrive and the missing component to their success, they weren't connected to the right people. As a community connector, Nancy Brodovsky is best able to bridge the gap. Since founding SacConnects Nancy is most proud of:

* Recruiting four board members to the Sacramento Ballet which enabled it to expand its realm of influence. The individuals brought excitement and enthusiasm to the ballet. *This signifiant influx in members increased the board size from 10 to 14 and invigorated the existing board.*
* Creating a Board of Advisors for Touro University California. Recruiting high powered, diverse, and energetic members to help the University raise its profile and problem solve issues that arise. *To date I have been responsible for seating 15 of the 23 new board members. The board is already functioning on behalf of the University.*
* Performing a board retreat for Hillel which board members said was one of the best they ever had, because she focused on giving them skills related to how to be a good board member, identify what excites them about their institution, and using a common sense approach to using email effectively. *Her enthusiastic presentation was infectious and the left excited to begin the coming year.*

Ultimately, her experience in the nonprofit world gives her a unique perspective to help charitable organizations and businesses be more successful in their nonprofit endeavors. *Nancy Brodovsky's large circle of contacts enables her to connect the right individuals with the right organizations.*
